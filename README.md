##Impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Stock Market 

<<<<<<< HEAD
This research aims to identify patterns in the stock prices of top publicly-traded companies in New Jersey in 2013, and the series of events and weather forecast predictions before and after Hurricane Sandy made landfall in southern New Jersey on October 29, 2012. This research will seek to determine if the variation of the stock prices of these companies was driven by weather forecast models, or if the changes were driven by occurrences unrelated to the extreme weather conditions.
