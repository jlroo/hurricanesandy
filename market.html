						For this research, weather forecast models before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy hit ground were analyzed and compared with the stock market during the same time. Some interesting trends arise when looking at stock prices of some companies in the north east region. One of the states that suffered the most devastation after Hurricane Sandy was New Jersey. For this reason, this research looked at 18 established companies located in New Jersey throughout the timeline of Hurricane Sandy, and found that none of the companies studied in this research had major earnings announcements, industry relevant news, or product releases during this period.

						By looking at 18 companies stock prices aggregate sum and using a Stacked area chart, its possible to get an idea of the total stock price for a week for this period at the same time that we can see the over all trend of these particular stocks were location of the headquarter in the common denominator. The Stacked area chart shows the behavior of the stocks and their overall performance during this period. Note: The dates on the graph represents the end of the week and not just open market days.Moreover to accurate measure change, the net stocks price change during the same period was plotted on a table showing significant trends that could be related to the weather forecast models.
						<br>
						<br>
						 This research also looked at the volume traded and its change, during the week before Sandy hit New Jersey (10/21/2012), the week during Sandy (11/01/2012) when the hurricane hit and the markets were close for two days, and finally two weeks after Sandy to see how the markets reacted. Further analysis of the stocks volume traded shows similar trends before and during Sandy, Its important to note that the stock volume traded variates mildly during this period (before and during Sandy) until the week of (11/18/2012) where there is a significant change in volume traded.

In order to determine the relationships between stocks in this research, a correlation analysis was performed. The goal was to see if changes in prices and volumes of two stocks during this period were correlated. By doing this, it could be determined if the two stocks' activities were correlated regardless of their respective industry. This research indicated that stock prices between most of the companies in this study were negatively correlated regardless of industry. This research also indicated that in regards to stock volume, significant correlations between companies were sparse. This could be due to the fact that the amount of stock available for each company differed. However, a few companies did share correlated values of traded volume.
